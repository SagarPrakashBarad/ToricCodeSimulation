    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing, an idea proposed by Richard Feynman in his famous Caltech lecture, is a powerful possible future tool for solving various optimization and physical problems previously inaccessible to classical computers. The cornerstone of building of a reliable quantum computer is implementation of fault-tolerant computation procedure, which is not susceptible to external noise and allows performing long computations. Such fault-tolerant computing can be implemented, as shown by Kitaev, within braiding the so-called anyons, new exotic particles with non-trivial mutual statistics. The latter is the defining feature of anyons and means that the system wave function in 2 dimensions picks up a non-zero phase (or even changes to a different state) when moving one anyon around the other. This non-trivial phase is topologically protected and guarantees high degree of resistivity to noise. Later on, Kitaev proposed the lattice spin model, Toric code, in paper \"[Fault-tolerant quantum computation by anyons](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9707021)\", in which those anyons are realized. Ironically, those anyons within this Toric code model were simulated by Google on a noisy superconducting computer. In this project, we aimed at reproduction of the results of this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good source for study is [Leggett's intro](https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/phys598PTD/fa2013/L26.pdf)\n",
    "to toric code."

    "The toric code Hamiltonian\n",
    "$$ H = -\\sum_{s} A_{s} - \\sum_{p} B_{p}$$\n",
    "is defined in terms of qubits living on the edges of a square lattice.\n",
    "The \"star\" operators $A_s = \\prod_{i\\in s} Z_i$ are products of Pauli $Z$ operators touching each star ($+$, blue). The \"plaquette\" operators $B_p = \\prod_{j \\in p} X_j$ are products of Pauli $X$ operators on each plaquette ($\\square$, purple).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all the operators in the toric code Hamiltonian commute, it is relatively simple to find ground state explicitly. For that we start from a state from which all stars are in ground state, i.e., $\\langle A_s \\rangle = 1$, which is in our case just $| 0 \\rangle^{\\otimes N}$ and then project it on the subspace for which $\\langle B_p \\rangle = 1$ by applying $(\\mathbb{I}+B_p)$ operator. This operator is then decomposed in a Hadamard operator on representative qubit, followed by a sequence of carefully ordered CNOT operators. This allows to prepare ground state in time linear in the width of the system."
